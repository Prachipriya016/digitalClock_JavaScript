# Clock Display Web Application

This is a simple web application that displays a clock with dynamic time updates. It's written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Usage

To use this code snippet, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

3. You'll see a clock displayed on the screen, and it will update the time every second.

## Code Explanation

The code uses JavaScript to retrieve the current time and update the clock's display every second. The CSS styles are used to format the clock and provide a hover effect. Here's a brief overview of the key components:

- The clock is retrieved from the DOM using `document.getElementById("clock")`.

- The `setInterval` function is used to update the clock every 1000 milliseconds (1 second). Inside the function, a new `Date` object is created to get the current time. The time is then displayed in the clock element, and its color is set to white.

- CSS styles are applied to the clock and other elements to format the display.

## Customization

You can customize the clock's appearance by modifying the CSS in the code. You can change the clock's size, colors, fonts, and other properties by editing the styles defined in the CSS section.

```css
.center{
  /* Your styles for centering content */
}

#clock{
  /* Your styles for the clock */
}

#clock:hover{
  /* Your styles for the clock on hover */
}

#banner{
  /* Your styles for the banner */
}
